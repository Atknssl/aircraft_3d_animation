A lightweight MATLAB(R) function to easily visualize flight test data recordings and outputs of nonlinar flight dynamics simulators. To download the official releases and rate `aircraft_3d_animation` function, please visit its page on [FileExchange](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22022).

Features
============
* Selectable maneuvre reproduction speed 
* Export maneuvre animation to an MP4 video file
* Highly customizable for other aircraft 3D model

Installation
============

1. Extract the ZIP file (or clone the git repository) somewhere you can easily reach it. 
2. Add the `src/` folder to your path in MATLAB/Octave: e.g. 
    - using the "Set Path" dialog in MATLAB, or 
    - by running the `addpath` function from your command window or `startup` script.
    
Usage
=====

Typical usage of `matlab2tikz` consists of converting your MATLAB plot to a TikZ/LaTeX file and then running a LaTeX compiler to produce your document.

```matlab
matlab2tikz('myfile.tex');
```
